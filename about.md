### Professionally

I'm an ADC Engineer/Architect at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu) in East Lansing, MI, USA. I'm primarily responsible for managing our F5 BIG-IP infrastructure and driving our automation and process improvement efforts in that space. I also work with other Architects in the Application Services space to help drive improvements to our overall enterprise environment.

### Un-Professionally

Outside of work I'm a father and husband and _The World's Okayest Tuba Player_. While _in these troubled times_, I'm not really playing in groups, in the past I've played with the [Midland Concert Band](https://www.midlandconcertband.com), [Mid-Michigan Brass Band](https://www.midmichiganbrassband.com), and most summers with the [Classic Legacy Band of Saginaw](https://classiclegacyband.com). I'm also a sometime photographer and lapsed beer league hockey player.
