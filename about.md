I'm an Associate Network Manager at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu) in Mount Pleasant, MI, USA. I'm primarily responsible for managing our F5 BIG-IP infrastructure and driving our automation and process improvement efforts. I also help support the campus network more genreally.

### Un-Professionally

Outside of work I'm a father and husband and _The World's Okayest Tuba Player_. I play regularly with the [Midland Concert Band](https://www.midlandconcertband.com), [Mid-Michigan Brass Band](https://www.midmichiganbrassband.com), and most summers with the [Classic Legacy Band of Saginaw](https://classiclegacyband.com).
